# The Odin Project Etch-a-Sketch Project

The assignment from The Odin Project is as follows:

1. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
2. Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would
3. Add a button on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g., 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.
